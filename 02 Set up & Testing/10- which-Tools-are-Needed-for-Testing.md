So let's dive into the testing setup

you need.

It all starts with the general application setup

for your main application,

for the main code you're writing,

for the product you're building,

even if you don't plan to add any testing.

Because that's, of course, the main thing you do.

You're building some product, some application,

no matter if it's a node, JS, or a react,

or any other kind of application,

you are building something in your writing code for that.

And for that, you have a project.

Now, that is something you definitely need,

no matter if you intend to add testing or not.

And that is also where you can stop already

if you don't want to add automated tests.

If you only plan to test your code manually

by clicking around in the demo website

with the development server you might have,

then that is all you need.

And that is what you see in a lot of projects,

and what you most likely also did a lot in the past.

In most of my others courses, we just have a project set up

without any automated tests

because I focus on the core topic at hand.

In the react course,

I have a react project without automated tests

because I focus on react features and concepts,

and we test everything manually in the demo website

that we get with help of the development server there.

But of course, in this course,

we want to dive into automated tests,

and therefore, we need to enhance this project setup.

And the good news here is that we can merge

our testing setup and our testing configuration

into this main project,

as you will see later in this section.

Now, your project setup without the testing parts

will typically also already come with

some configuration and some extra tools.

For example, you might be using Webpack, or Vite,

or Babel there to optimize and transform your code.

And the exact set up depends on the project you have.

And very often,

you don't create that project configuration on your own,

but instead, very often, you use some tool,

like the create react app tool or the angular CLI,

to create a project for you

that comes with a certain configuration out of the box

so that you can focus on the actual code you write.

So that is what you always have, basically,

because you need that to build a product,

to build an application, to write code.

But then, if you want to add automated tests,

you need extra tools that are added to this project.

For example, you need to add a test runner.

You also will need an assertion library, typically.

But what are these things?

What are these tools?

A test runner, as the name suggests,

is a tool that actually executes your testing code.

Because tests are all the just code you write,

but not code that belongs

to your main application or product,

but instead, code that's there to test your other code.

And that testing code should be executed

by such a test runner

because it's not part of your main application code.

You don't execute it together

with your main application code.

Instead, you have a dedicated testing tool,

a test runner tool that executes your test code only

during development.

Such a test runner typically automatically

detects your testing code

as long as you place your testing code

in certain files that follow a certain naming schema,

but you will learn more about that later.

The test runner then also is responsible

for executing your tests,

gathering the results of these tests,

and displaying the results of these tests.

And there are different test runner tools you could add.

It depends on the programming language you're using,

but then you also often got multiple alternatives

for one in the same language.

For example, for JavaScript tests,

a popular test runner is Jest.

Actually, Jest is more than just a test runner,

but it also is capable of running tests.

But Karma would be a popular alternative.

Though, I will say that Jest became more popular

over the past years.

So that's one important part.

But a test runner, as the name suggests,

only executes your tests.

You also, of course, need to then define

what makes a test successful or not.

So you don't just need to execute your testing code,

but you also need some way of defining expectations,

expected results, and what's treated as a success,

and what should be treated as a failure instead.

And that's where an assertion library comes into play.

Because with assertion libraries,

you can define your expected outcomes.

And the assertion library will then check if the code

that's tested, if you're testing code,

actually produces a result that matches those expectations.

So whether your expectations are met.

And good assertion libraries should, of course,

support all kinds of possible outcomes and situations,

including synchronous versus asynchronous code, and so on.

Now, again, the tool you will choose

depends on the programming language you're using.

And even inside of one of the same language,

like JavaScript, you have alternatives,

like for example, again, Jest for JavaScript, or Chai.

Now, as you can see on this slide already,

Jest seems to be a tool that supports both aspects

which is, of course, great,

because it means you only need to install one tool

and configure only one tool

to get both important features you need

for defining and running tests.

So that's the overview of a testing setup

of how it should look like and which tools are needed.

In the next lectures, I will now walk you

through an example project and an example setup

which also adds a test runner and an assertion library.

And I will also explain why I'm actually not using

Jest in this course, but instead, a different tool

which, in my opinion, is even better,

and which is gaining a lot of traction lately.

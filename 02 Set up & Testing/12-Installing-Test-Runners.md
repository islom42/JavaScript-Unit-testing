Now I did already show you this example

and indeed using vitest in your project,

no matter if it's a frontend project or a node project

as I have it here, using it is as simple as running

npm install --save-dev and then vitest.

You'll run this command, this installs it

into your JavaScript project.

Again, no matter if it's NodeJS or frontend JavaScript.

And then with that installed,

all you need to do is in your package.json file,

you add the test script and you set the value

either to just vitest or vitest --globals.

The --globals flag just makes sure that you can use

special functions like it or expect,

about which you will learn more throughout this course

without any extra imports.

But that is how easy it is to use vitest.

Now, all that being said, I will provide you with projects

where I already set up everything so that we can get started

with testing, because this course is about learning

to test and to write tests, it's not about learning

how to configure different kinds of projects,

hence, I will provide them to you

so that we can focus on the essentials here.

Of course, if you wanna learn more about vitest

or about Jest, check out their official docs,

check out the details you can learn there

to dive really deeply into it.

But with that, that's the kind of setup we're going to use

in this course and that's the kind of setup

we're going to use to learn all about tests.

So let's now explore the testing setup

we'll use in this course

and talk about various alternatives that we have.

As mentioned before,

it all starts with our application setup,

with the project itself.

And when it comes to that setup,

it really does not matter which kind of application it is.

It could be a simple node express

or any other node JS framework project,

but it also could be a front end JavaScript project,

either with plain JavaScript, maybe combined with a bundler

or a built tool like VEED or web Pack, which is very popular

but it could also be of course

a react or an angular project.

It really does not matter,

it's any kind of JavaScript project.

It could also be a type script project, whatever it is,

what you'll learn in this course will apply

to that kind of project, the way you write tests

and the idea behind writing tests will always be the same.

Now certain types of projects that might have been created

with certain tools, for example,

React projects that were created with Create React app

or angular projects that were created

with the Angular CLI, such kinds of projects

typically already have a full testing workflow built in

and you can dive right into writing tests.

And what you will learn in this course will help you

with these kinds of projects as well

because the way you write tests and actually

also the code you write is pretty much always the same.

It would have to be a very specific kind of configuration

or setup that those things would change.

But even then, the general idea,

the approach towards testing and the logic

that goes into your tests would still be the same.

But of course you also might have a project

which you are creating from scratch on your own,

especially if it's a Node JS back end project,

but also for some front end projects,

you might not always have a predefined testing

configuration and workflow.

And as mentioned on this slide before,

you then need such a test runner

and such an assertion library, which you add

to your project setup and which you configure

such that it works in your project setup up.

If you use something like Create React app

or the angular CLI, they already pre-install

and pre-configure these kinds of tools for you.

If you're doing it manually, then well,

you have to do it manually.

Now you already see on this slide that Jest

seems to be a very helpful tool because it's mentioned

for both the Test Runner and Assertion Library category

and indeed Jest is a very popular tool for testing.

And you can use it with all kinds of projects

as you can see on their official website.

There, if you dive into the documentation,

you also learn how you can get started.

And it is indeed super simple.

Here's a very simple example where I installed Jest

into a basic Node express application.

I then just added one file with a test in it.

And of course is we're going to learn

what all this code is all about

and how this works and why I did write this code.

But with that, I can just run NPM test.

Since I configured my package.JSON file appropriately

and my test is executed.

Again, we're going to learn all the details

of what's happening here

and what this command does throughout this course,

but it's super simple to get started with Jest

and that's the reason why it is quite popular,

but Jest also has its disadvantages and downsides.

It can be a bit slow.

And especially if you have a project that uses ES modules

so that uses not common JS as I'm using it here,

but that uses instead those import export statements,

which you know from a lot of front end projects especially,

but which you also can use with Node JS.

If you're using these ES modules,

this other kind of import export Syntex,

then Jest kind of supports it.

It does support ECMAScript modules

but support is only experimental.

And in my experience, setting it up and making it work

with this other import Syntex can be very annoying

and you often end up installing extra tools

and you set up an extra workflow

for testing where the code gets transpiled and changed

behind the scenes, which is always a bit annoying

if your main code works just like that

without any extra setup and you then need

some extra configuration just to make your tests work.

That's not really the idea behind testing.

You don't wanna test something different

than you run in production,

even though it's just a behind the scenes transpolation,

but still, Jest does have its downsides,

even though it's very popular.

Now you absolutely can work around those downsides.

But in this course, we're going to use Vitest.

It's a pretty new, pretty popular, all ready, tool

which also allows you to write tests.

And it is compatible with Jest syntax.

It has an API that allows you to write your tests

in the same way you would write them for Jest basically,

plus some extra convenience features

which are really nice to have.

And it works with ES modules out of the box.

It also works with common JS.

So with this import Syntex

and just to give you an example

of how easy it is to use Jest,

here's the exact same project

as I showed you a couple of seconds ago

with the same testing code, but now I swapped out Jest

for Vitest and changed the testing command.

And with that done, I can still run NPM test

and I still run all my tests as before.

So therefore in this course

we're going to use Vitest because it's a bit faster.

It has this better ES modules support.

And as you can see here,

the code you write in your tests is the same

as you would do for Jest.

So the vast majority of what you learn

in this course can be applied one to one

in the same way in a Jest project.

And you got this more modern tool

behind the scenes to all the advantages of this as well.

So therefore in this course, we're going to use Vitest

and just like Jest,

Vitest is both a test runner and an assertion library.

So we don't need any other extra setup.

We can just use Vitest for both.

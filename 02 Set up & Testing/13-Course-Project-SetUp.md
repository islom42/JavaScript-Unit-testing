Now as mentioned,

for the next course sections,

I already prepared some projects for you.

Some projects, which contains some demo dummy code,

which we can use to write some tests for that code,

but also some projects,

where I already installed Vitest for you,

and set everything up,

such that we can just get started running those tests,

and you don't have to go through all the setup

and installation process on your own.

Now attached, you find a link that gives you

free project folders, three demo project folders,

which all produce the same website in the end,

but which use different approaches.

We have some back-end and some front-end code in there,

and we have different ways of achieving the final result

of giving you a website, which shows a basic calculator

that you can use to calculate a number in the end.

Now, every project is simply just a folder

with a bunch of code files inside of it,

and every folder has a package.json file,

which defines the dependencies that project.

Now, if you go through these package.json files,

you will note that in all these package.json files,

I'm installing vitest,

but in two of the three package.json files,

I also use express, as a dependency.

These two projects here, basic-testing-nodejs

and basic-testing-nodejs-esmodules, are back-end projects.

They are node express apps,

node express projects, in the end.

The other project as the folder name already reveals

is a front-end application, so to say,

and therefore here, I don't install express,

I just have some development dependencies.

For example, a basic HTTP server,

which serves this index HTML file,

which contains a basic form.

And this file also imports app.js,

which is a JavaScript file with some code

that also imports other files.

Now, regarding the imports,

I wanna mention that here, in the front-end app,

I am using ES modules, ECMAScript modules.

So this import syntax here,

and this export syntax like this,

which you might know from many projects.

For example, from react projects, angular projects,

in all those projects, you typically use ECMAScript modules.

And the browser supports this import export syntax

out of the box.

If you import your main script like this,

with the type equals module attribute.

If that is brand new to you, you definitely wanna check out

some basic JavaScript resources first,

before diving deeper into this course.

For example, my JavaScript, the complete guide course,

where I teach about dis import syntax, as well.

For the node project,

I have two different variants of one of the same app.

For the basic-testing-nodejs app,

I'm using the CommonJS import, which looks like this,

which you most likely already know

if you ever worked with node before

because that is the default import syntax you know there,

and the export syntax then, looks like this.

Alternatively, I could have also used

module exports equaled something,

but that is how I could export multiple things

from one file.

But this is the syntax you should know,

if you worked with node before.

As a side note for this course,

you don't need to know Node.js.

You don't need to fully understand all that code.

You will still be able to understand all the testing parts.

You should, of course,

have some basic JavaScript knowledge though.

But this is regular Node.js code.

I also got a different variant of that same project though,

where I set the type setting here in package.json to module.

And therefore, here, I then also use ES modules

for importing and export.

This also the works here.

This is supported by modern Node.js,

if you have a recent version of Node.js

installed on your system,

which you of course should do.

Now here, I then have the same app,

but I'm using this different import export syntax,

which you also know from the front-end.

Now, all three projects, which we have here,

in the end give you the same kind of app.

And we can see this in action if we open the terminal.

For example, the terminal built into VS Code,

and we then for example, dive into the front-end project.

There, you first of all, need to run npm install,

to install all the dependencies.

And for this, you also must have Node.js installed.

And once you ran npm install here,

you can run npm start in this front-end project.

This starts a little development server in the end,

which hosts this index.html file on localhost, 8080.

And if you open localhost 8080 in your browser,

you will see something like this.

By the way, I zoomed in quite a bit here,

which is why it's that big for me?

It will be smaller for you, if you're not zooming in.

There is no styling that would make it that big.

Now, here we get a basic calculator.

If I don't enter anything, I get this error.

If I enter valid numbers, I get the expected result though.

Also, if I'm using negative numbers.

And if I manipulate this,

by using the browser developer tools,

and are for example change the type of the input here

from numeric to text,

so that I can enter something like hello here,

then I also get an error message.

Now, that was the front-end application,

but it's pretty much the same,

just achieved differently behind the scenes

for my Node.js applications.

If you do navigate into the basic-testing-nodejs folder,

and you run npm install in there,

to install all the dependencies,

then you need to execute this app.js file here with node,

by running node app.js.

And this will then start a server,

a Node.js server on port 3000, on local host port 3000.

And if you open that, you see the same as before.

And it also has the same functionality, as it did before.

So that is really the same thing here.

That is what we can see here in action.

And the same would be true if you run the other node app,

if you navigate

into the basic-testing-nodejs-esmodules project,

and you run npm install there.

Once all the dependencies were installed,

you can run the app.js file, by running node app.js.

And once that's happening, if you reload,

you again got that same app here, like this,

so we can still work with that.

So it's the same project

with different ways of achieving the result

using server-side code for the Node.js project,

using front-end JavaScript code for the front-end project.

But it's the same app in the end,

and it's this demo dummy app, which I'm providing to you,

which we're going to use to learn about testing.

Now, I have these different versions the same app

to show you that what you learn about testing

will apply to both front-end, and back-end JavaScript code.

So to browser side JavaScript code

and the note JS JavaScript code,

and that it also does not matter

whether you're using CommonJS

for importing and exporting here on the back-end,

or ES modules.

And with that, that is the setup we're going to use

for the near future.

Not the only setup, not the only code,

not the only project we'll see in this course,

but it is what we'll use in the next section,

to get started with the basics of testing.

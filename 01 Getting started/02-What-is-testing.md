So what is testing?

Well, testing is a broad term,

and, in the end, it always typically means

that we want to verify whether something works as intended.

And when writing software or building websites,

which, in the end, is writing some software,

then we typically want to test whether that software

or that website we're building

is working the way we expect it to work.

And we can, of course, verify that.

We can test a piece of software or a website

by doing some manual testing,

but manual testing will have a couple of downsides

and that's why we also can do some automated testing

in addition to manual testing.

Now manual testing, of course, means that we, for example,

visit our demo website locally on our system

whilst we're building it.

So we spin up some development server,

and we test the website whilst we're working on it,

and we test the various features

whilst we're working on the site.

And this is very important,

and something you definitely wanna do,

and not something you should avoid,

but, of course, it's also tedious and cumbersome.

It's especially cumbersome if you don't just test

the feature you are currently working on,

but if you always have to test all the features

and all the different ways of using a website

whenever you make a tiny change.

And you might wanna test all these possible scenarios

because, of course, maybe you changed one part of a website

and because of that change some other part stops working.

If you don't test everything, you will miss

that something stopped working, and that can be a problem.

But, of course, if you do start testing the entire site,

all its features, and everything that's involved

in the site, every time you make a tiny change

then you have a lot of work to do.

And that's where automated testing comes into play.

With automated testing, the idea is that you write some code

that tests your code.

Yeah, so you're writing extra code,

which is executed during development

or whenever you added a new feature,

and this code will then run a predefined list of tests

that test various aspects of your site automatically,

always by following the exact same steps and flows,

therefore, when you add automated testing to your toolbox,

you have some initial setup effort,

and you have to write the testing code initially,

but thereafter you have no effort.

With manual testing, it's error prone.

It's easy to forget to test a certain part of the website,

and it's not guaranteed that you always test everything

in the same reliable way.

You might test a certain feature in different ways

at different point of times.

If you have automated tests,

if you wrote code that tests your main code,

then that code will always execute in the same way,

and it will always perform the same test.

It's, therefore, predictable and consistent.

In addition with manual testing,

a downside is that it's, of course,

often incomplete because you might forget to test

a certain scenario or aspect.

With automated tests, once you defined a test

it will always be executed when you run all your tests,

therefore, it's much easier to achieve a high amount

of code coverage, and it's easier to make sure

that you test all kinds of different scenarios.

Whenever you find out that there is a certain scenario

or user behavior you want to test,

you can just write a new test and add it to your project,

and the next time you run all your tests

this new test will also be included.

So, therefore, automated testing is something

you should strongly consider adding to your projects,

and, as mentioned, it's not a replacement

for manual testing.

Manual testing is important,

especially when you are currently working on the project,

but you should not only do manual testing.

Instead, you should also add

automated tests to your projects.

And this course is, of course, all about automated testing.

You will learn how to add such tests to your project,

how to execute them, and, of course,

most importantly, how to write them,

and which kind of logic should go into your testing code.

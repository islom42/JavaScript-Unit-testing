Now, before we come to an end

for this section here

I also briefly wanna talk

about another testing related concept

which is Test-Driven Development.

Now Test Driven Development is in the end a framework

or a philosophy for writing tests, you could say.

And the idea behind test a driven development

is that you don't write your application code first

and then some tests for that code

but that instead as a first test

before you write any application code,

you write failing tests.

Where you in the end define the expected behavior,

then you implement the code that should be tested

which of course should be implemented

such that the behavior is met

and the test therefore succeeds.

And then you can iteratively refactor

and go through that flow over and over again,

and write a new test

whenever you want to add a new behavior or a new unit

write a failing test first, then implement the logic,

maybe optimize the logic thereafter and so on.

And that is one interesting way of writing your tests.

This course is not about test driven development though.

This course is about learning the fundamentals

of unit testing and how to write tests and stat.

And once you finished this course,

you of course would be ready to also explore

the concept of Test-Driven Development if you want to.

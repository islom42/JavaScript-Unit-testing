Besides Unit Testing,

we also have #integration and #end-to-end testing.

And actually, there are other kinds of testing as well,

for example, accessibility testing

but these three kinds of tests

are the most common and popular forms

of automated tests that you will encounter

in most pieces of software and most websites.

And as a side note, the concept of automated testing

is not exclusive to JavaScript.

It exists in basically all programming languages,

so what you learn here will indirectly also help you

with other languages in case you're interested.

Now, we did learn about Unit Testing

in the previous lecture.

We learned that it's about testing

the individual building blocks,

functions and classes that make up our application

and that all these building blocks are tested standalone.

And the idea, as mentioned in the previous lecture,

is that if our building blocks work,

the entire application should work.

Now, with integration testing,

we build up on unit tests

and we actually also test

the combination of building blocks,

the combination of units.

And we verify that if different units

are executed together or are working together,

the overall app still works as intended

because the idea is that even

if all our buildings blocks do work correctly individually,

once we combine them,

they might not work as expected anymore.

And I will come back to this idea later in the course

because in this course,

we'll also take a look at integration testing

and see how it's related to unit tests

and how you can write integration tests.

Now, end-to-end testing then is a different kind of testing,

which is not directly related to unit

or integration testing.

The idea behind end-to-end testing

is that you focus on specific user behaviors

or specific API interfaces your application

might be providing and you test entire flows,

entire application features.

For example, if you're building

an image upload API endpoint,

you might want to test the entire image upload workflow,

which includes extracting the image

from the incoming request

and then storing it on the file system.

With unit tests, you would test the individual parts

that make up the flow.

With integration tests, you might test combinations

of those blocks.

With end-to-end tests, you would test the entire flow.

So with end-to-end tests,

you test the actual things,

real users or programs interacting

with your program would do.

So therefore, these are the most realistic kinds

of tests you could say

but they also bring their own challenges

and ultimately, you should combine all these kinds

of tests in your projects.

You should write unit tests,

you should then also add some integration tests

and you typically also wanna add some end-to-end tests

for those important user behaviors

and complete processes that take place inside of your app.

You wanna have unit tests because those allow you

to quickly spot and pinpoint breaking changes.

With unit tests, it's easy to tell which part

of the application is affected by a change

because you test all these parts individually.

But of course, unit tests do ignore the actual user flows

and interferences, instead,

you test these individual building blocks.

Now, you do have some combinations

with integration testing

but you still only test the combinations you wanna test.

Therefore, you don't model

the entire user behavior flows there

but just selected combinations of units.

Now, once you switch to integration testing,

it, of course, becomes a bit harder to spot

which exact part or unit of an application broke

because of a change

because you're testing the combination of units.

Now, with end-to-end tests, as mentioned,

you do test those realistic behaviors

of users and those realistic flows,

those realistic processes that take part of your application

but, of course, with end-to-end testing,

it becomes tricky to cover all possible behaviors

that can be challenging

and if things do go wrong,

it, of course, can take some extra work

to find out which exact part of the application broke

and which part of the application

is causing a certain test to fail.

As mentioned, you typically wanna add all these kinds

of tests, and we have this concept of a testing pyramid

where you might wanna add a lot of unit tests,

basically test for all your units

that make up your app,

all your functions and classes

and not just one test per unit

but instead, multiple tests per unit

as you will also learn in this course.

Then you wanna add some integration tests

and you wanna have a couple of end-to-end tests

for the most important behaviors and processes in your app.

This, however, is no hard rule

and there definitely are also people advocating

that you should have more end-to-end tests

than unit tests.

Ultimately, knowing all kinds of tests

is a good idea, and with this course,

you will learn how to write and add unit

and integration tests,

which are super important fundamentals you always must know

when it comes to writing automated tests for your programs.

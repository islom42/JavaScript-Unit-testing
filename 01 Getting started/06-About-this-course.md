So at this point,

we have a first basic understanding of what testing is.

And you're going to learn about all the details

throughout this course, of course.

But that leads us to the final lecture

of this first section.

What can you expect from this course?

What's inside this course?

Well, we're all almost done getting started.

And in the next course section,

we will explore which tools we need,

which software we need to install

to write and run our tests.

And we will dive into an example project setup.

How you could add a testing environment to a project

and I will provide you with a finished demo project

or actually multiple demo projects that have tests enabled

and that have all the required tools installed into them.

Now once the environment is set up,

after that next course section,

we are going to dive into testing itself.

We'll explore are the fundamentals

you have to know when it comes to writing

automated unit tests

and will explore how such tests are written

and which logic goes into such tests.

We'll follow that up by diving into some best practices

and common patterns you should be aware of.

So you will learn how you can write good tests

and what should and shouldn't be tested with your tests

before we then dive into more advanced testing concepts.

For that, will explore integration tests,

but also dive into important concepts

like testing asynchronous code.

Now that will then give you a very solid lit foundation

but if you dive a bit deeper into testing

and into writing automated tests,

you'll often see that you'll have problems

when your production code, your main code

has some side effects in side of it.

Writing tests for a code that has side effects

can be challenging as you will learn thereafter,

and you will learn how you can deal with such side effects

and how you can write tests

that deal with a more complex code

by diving into mocks and spies

and will not just scratch the surface there,

but instead also dive really deep into these concepts.

And of course, as for the rest of the course,

also practice all these things

by diving into multiple demos and examples.

So this entire course is a practical guide

packed with examples and demos.

We'll then conclude this course

by taking a look at front end JavaScript testing

by looking at a very specific problem you will often face

when working with front end JavaScript

and that would be the DOM, the document object model.

You will learn how you can write tests for a code

that interacts with the DOM

and how you can manipulate and prepare the DOM as needed

in your testing code.

Now that's the content and all these things, of course,

will become much clearer as you progress through the course

and you'll learn about all these concepts.

But that is the content of the course.

I also wanna make sure

that you get the most out of this content.

And since this is a video course,

to be precise, a video on demand course,

the most important aspect

of getting the most out of this course

is of course to watch the video videos, but very important,

watch them at your own pace.

Since this is a video on demand course,

you can pause videos whenever you need to,

you can speed them up, slow them down

or watch a video multiple times

if a certain concept isn't clear the first time

and you should definitely do that.

Take advantage of this on demand nature of this course

and make sure you get the most out of these videos.

But besides watching the videos,

I also recommend that you code along.

I will show you many examples

and I will write many tests as part of these videos.

And you will get the most out of this course

if you also sometimes pause the videos

and you practice writing tests on your own.

You write the testing code on your own

and you also experiment with that code.

Don't just do what I show you in the videos.

Instead, also feel free to write variations of the tests

I will write in the videos.

Write additional tests.

Really play around with it

and get a feeling for how that code works

and what you can do with tests.

Now, this course also comes with course resources

and attachments.

Actually in the next lecture,

so the last lecture of this first course section,

you will find a link to a GitHub repository

where you can get all the tests we write in this course,

where you can get multiple code snapshots

for the different sections of this course to be precise

so that you can compare your solutions to mine,

and you can also find errors in your code and in your tests

and compare your code and your tests

with my code that I show in the various videos.

So the next lecture leads you to all these project snapshots

all the testing code, and all other resources I provide

as part of this course.

Now last but not least,

this course also comes with a Q and A section.

And if you are stuck, if something's not clear,

you can of course also use that section to seek help.

But my strong recommendation,

which you should take really seriously,

is that you don't just go there and you ask for help,

but you instead also reply to others.

Because by replying to others and helping other students

you will learn way more.

Because you have to think about a problem,

come up with a solution and then write down that solution.

And this is one of the best ways to really learn

a certain concept in depth

and to make sure that you really understand

a certain concept.

So don't just ask, also answer, help each other

and make sure that we all grow together

as we go through this course.

And therefore with that, that's it for this section.

We can now finally dive into setting up a project,

setting everything up for testing,

and then into writing tests.
